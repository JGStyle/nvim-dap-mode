# About

using dap in neovim is amazing, however the keyboard controls can be quite annoying and don't match neovims speed

## what does it do

while you're actively debugging in normal mode, just use 

 - o : to jump over
 - i : to jump into
 - b : to toggle Breakpoint
 - H : to Hover over an item and show the current value

if you're not debugging, the keybinds will be back to the original value
